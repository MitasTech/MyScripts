# Welcome Everyone!
Here you can find my automated scripts to install AUR Helpers and Window Managers.
Currently there are only four Window Managers Available. 
1) Qtile
2) Hyprland
3) XMonad
4) BSPWM

I plan to add more within the next few days.
My goal with this script is for you guys to be able to choose which window manager you want,
and the process will happen automatically while configure it exactly as my own system with my own configs
and customizations.

I hope you like it and enjoy!

Here are the steps in order to use it.

1) Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/MitasTech/MyScripts


To run it first you need to make the scripts executable.

2) cd MyScripts
   chmod +x install.sh

Then change directory to the Scripts dirextory and do the same for the other 2 scripts.

3) Once you complete step 2, go back here:
    cd ~/MyScripts

And run the script using this command

    ./install.sh

This will start the script and you are going to have a few option where you can choose from.
Select which one would you like, and thats it!

Stay safe and enjoy!
